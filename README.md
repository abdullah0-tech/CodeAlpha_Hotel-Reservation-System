# CodeAlpha_Hotel-Reservation-System
The Hotel Reservation System is a Java console app that lets users search, book, and cancel rooms by category (Standard, Deluxe, Suite). It simulates payments, manages reservations, and displays booking details. Data is persisted with file I/O, and the system uses OOP to handle rooms, users, and reservations efficiently.
